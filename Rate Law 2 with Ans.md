**Rate Law Exercise**

The rate of a chemical reaction is the change in the concentration of a reactant or product per unit time. The rate law for a reaction is an equation that relates the rate of the reaction to the concentrations of the reactants.

The general form of a rate law is:

$$rate = k[A]^x[B]^y$$

where $k$ is the rate constant, $[A]$ is the concentration of reactant A, $[B]$ is the concentration of reactant B, and $x$ and $y$ are the orders of the reaction with respect to A and B, respectively.

The order of a reaction is the exponent to which the concentration of a reactant is raised in the rate law. The order of a reaction can be determined experimentally by plotting the concentration of a reactant versus time and observing the shape of the graph.

The following is an example of a rate law for the reaction of A and B to form C:

$$rate = k[A][B]^2$$

In this case, the order of the reaction with respect to A is 1 and the order of the reaction with respect to B is 2.

To solve a rate law exercise, you will need to know the following:

* The balanced chemical equation for the reaction
* The initial concentrations of the reactants
* The concentration of one of the reactants at a given time

Once you have this information, you can use the following steps to solve the rate law exercise:

1. Write the rate law for the reaction.
2. Substitute the initial concentrations of the reactants into the rate law.
3. Substitute the concentration of one of the reactants at a given time into the rate law.
4. Solve for the rate constant.
5. Determine the order of the reaction with respect to each reactant.

The following is an example of a rate law exercise:

The reaction of A and B to form C is first order in A and second order in B. The initial concentrations of A and B are 0.1 M and 0.2 M, respectively. The concentration of A at 2 minutes is 0.08 M. What is the rate constant for the reaction?

To solve this exercise, we will follow the steps outlined above:

1. The rate law for the reaction is:

$$rate = k[A][B]^2$$

2. Substituting the initial concentrations of the reactants into the rate law, we get:

$$rate = k(0.1 M)(0.2 M)^2 = 0.04 M^2 s^{-1}$$

3. Substituting the concentration of A at 2 minutes into the rate law, we get:

$$0.04 M^2 s^{-1} = k(0.08 M)(0.2 M)^2$$

4. Solving for the rate constant, we get:

$$k = 0.025 M^{-1} s^{-1}$$

5. The order of the reaction with respect to A is 1 and the order of the reaction with respect to B is 2.

Therefore, the rate law for the reaction is:

$$rate = 0.025 M^{-1} s^{-1}[A][B]^2$$

Here is an answer key for the rate law exercise:

1. The rate law for the reaction is:

$$rate = k[A][B]^2$$

2. The rate constant is $0.025 M^{-1} s^{-1}$.

3. The order of the reaction with respect to A is 1.

4. The order of the reaction with respect to B is 2.
